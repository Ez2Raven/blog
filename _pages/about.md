As an individual, I am motivated more from within, and my inspiration to act is based on confidence in my rationality. Rarely concerned about the opinions of others, I work best when given opportunities to exercise independence and making my own decisions.

As a team member, I gather inputs from peers before committing to decisions that affect the scalability and maintainability of a software solution. In cases of dispute, I prefer to facilitate decision making using statistics and data. At times of instability, I am often motivated to draft constraints to introduce a level of consistency.

With my passion in technologies and experience in software engineering, I look forward to contributing to cross cutting technical needs such as security, software development and product delivery.
